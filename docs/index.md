## Welcome to Nexus Framework

Nexus is a cutting-edge, extensible framework designed to empower developers to build, deploy, and manage sophisticated AI agents and multi-agent systems. It provides the foundational infrastructure for creating intelligent agents that can collaborate, reason, and interact with various tools and data sources to automate complex tasks and build next-generation software applications.

## Main Features

- **Modular Agent Architecture**: Build agents as independent, reusable modules with specialized skills.
- **Inter-Agent Communication**: Enable agents to discover each other's capabilities and interact through standardized protocols.
- **IDE Integration**: Expose agent capabilities as tools and resources, allowing direct interaction from environments like Claude Desktop and VSCode.
- **Flexible LLM Integration**: Support for multiple LLM providers with a unified interface.
- **Robust Security**: Multi-layered security for authentication, authorization, and data protection.
- **Comprehensive Observability**: Structured logging, monitoring, and distributed tracing to understand agent behavior.
- **Extensible by Design**: Plugin architecture for adding new agent types, LLM connectors, tools, and communication adapters.
