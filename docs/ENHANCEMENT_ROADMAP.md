## Overview

This document outlines the planned enhancements for the Nexus Framework to transform it from a prototype to a production-ready agent orchestration system with enterprise-grade reliability features.

## Architecture Vision

The enhanced architecture focuses on:

1. **Reliability** - Ensuring message delivery even during system failures
2. **Scalability** - Supporting increased load and more complex agent interactions
3. **Observability** - Comprehensive visibility into system behavior
4. **Security** - Robust validation and permission checks throughout
5. **Extensibility** - Well-defined interfaces for future capabilities
