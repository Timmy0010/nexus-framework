# Nexus Advanced Agent Framework

A flexible, extensible framework for building and managing AI agent systems.

## Overview

Nexus is a cutting-edge framework designed to empower developers to build, deploy, and manage sophisticated AI agents and multi-agent systems. It provides the foundational infrastructure for creating intelligent agents that can collaborate, reason, and interact with various tools and data sources to automate complex tasks and build next-generation software applications.

## Key Features

- **Modular Agent Architecture**: Build agents as independent, reusable modules with specialized skills.
- **Inter-Agent Communication**: Enable agents to discover each other's capabilities and interact through standardized protocols.
- **IDE Integration**: Expose agent capabilities as tools and resources, allowing direct interaction from environments like Claude Desktop and VSCode.
- **Flexible LLM Integration**: Support for multiple LLM providers with a unified interface.
- **Robust Security**: Multi-layered security for authentication, authorization, and data protection.
- **Comprehensive Observability**: Structured logging, monitoring, and distributed tracing to understand agent behavior.
- **Extensible by Design**: Plugin architecture for adding new agent types, LLM connectors, tools, and communication adapters.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
pip install nexus-framework
```

### Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of creating and using agents with the Nexus framework:

```python
import nexus_framework as nf

# Configure logging
nf.configure_logging(log_level="INFO")

# Create a communication bus
comm_bus = nf.CommunicationBus()

# Create agents
user_agent = nf.UserProxyAgent(agent_name="User")
assistant_agent = nf.AssistantAgent(agent_name="Assistant")

# Register agents with the communication bus
comm_bus.register_agent(user_agent)
comm_bus.register_agent(assistant_agent)

# Create a group chat manager
chat_manager = nf.NexusGroupChatManager(
    agents=[user_agent, assistant_agent],
    communication_bus=comm_bus
)

# Start a conversation
messages = chat_manager.run_chat(
    initial_sender=user_agent,
    initial_message_content="Hello, can you help me with a question about Python?"
)

# Print the conversation
for msg in messages:
    sender = "User" if msg.sender_id == user_agent.agent_id else "Assistant"
    print(f"{sender}: {msg.content}")
```

## Advanced Usage

For more complex scenarios, Nexus supports:

- Task planning and decomposition
- Tool integration via the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Multi-agent collaboration for complex problem-solving
- Robust error handling and state management
- Comprehensive observability for debugging and monitoring
