# Contributing to Nexus Framework

First of all, thank you for considering contributing to the Nexus Framework! This project aims to create a powerful, flexible framework for building AI agent systems, and we need the help of the community to make it the best it can be.

This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the Nexus Framework. By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.

## Code of Conduct

We want to foster an inclusive and respectful community around the Nexus Framework. Please be respectful and constructive in your communications with other contributors and maintainers.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub.
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nexus-framework.git
   cd nexus-framework
   ```
3. **Set up the development environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```
4. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Process

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** to see if your problem or idea has already been addressed.
2. **Create an issue** to discuss major changes before putting significant effort into them.
3. **Look at the project board** to understand current priorities and work in progress.

### Making Changes

1. **Follow the coding style** of the project (PEP 8 for Python code).
2. **Add or update tests** to cover your changes.
3. **Add or update documentation** as necessary.
4. **Make sure all tests pass** locally before submitting a pull request.

### Commit Messages

Follow these guidelines for commit messages:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
  - üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
  - üìù `:memo:` when adding or updating documentation
  - ‚ú® `:sparkles:` when adding a new feature
  - üîß `:wrench:` when dealing with configuration
  - üöÄ `:rocket:` when improving performance
  - üß™ `:test_tube:` when adding tests

### Pull Requests

1. **Update your fork** to the latest upstream changes before submitting a pull request.
2. **Create a pull request** from your feature branch to the main repository.
3. **Include a clear description** of the changes made and any relevant issue numbers.
4. **Make sure CI passes** for your pull request.
5. **Be responsive to feedback** and be willing to make changes to your pull request if requested.

## Testing

Run tests locally with pytest:

```bash
pytest
```

For coverage reports:

```bash
pytest --cov=nexus_framework
```

## Coding Standards

### Python

- Follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) for all Python code.
- Use type hints wherever possible.
- Write docstrings for all public classes, methods, and functions.
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility.

### Documentation

- Use Markdown for documentation files.
- Add code examples for non-obvious features.
- Keep the API documentation up to date with code changes.
